# Lab X

Improved version:

**Lab X** is a **Virtual Lab Project** that focuses on developing innovative, interactive learning environments. The project includes an **AI-supported language learning module** designed to improve learners’ pronunciation, listening, and writing skills in English. This module uses **speech recognition technology** to provide real-time, interactive feedback, helping learners—especially children—enhance their speaking accuracy, listening comprehension, and writing performance through engaging digital activities.
.

As part of the AI for Kids initiative, it integrates educational games that make learning engaging and adaptive to each learner’s progress. Students can listen to words or sentences, repeat them, and receive instant AI-generated feedback on pronunciation quality. Writing tasks are also supported with automated assessment and suggestions for improvement.

The module is accessible online at **https://gflm.umy.ac.id** where users can explore the learning games and AI-powered tools developed under this research-based virtual learning ecosystem.

# Lab X

Lab S is a Virtual Lab. This project also includes an AI-supported language learning module designed for pronunciation, listening, and writing practice in English. This module uses speech recognition technology to help learners, especially children, improve their English speaking accuracy and comprehension through interactive feedback.

As part of the AI for Kids initiative, it integrates educational games that make learning engaging and adaptive to each learnerâ€™s progress. Students can listen to words or sentences, repeat them, and receive instant AI-generated feedback on pronunciation quality. Writing tasks are also supported with automated assessment and suggestions for improvement.

The module is accessible online at **https://gflm.umy.ac.id** where users can explore the learning games and AI-powered tools developed under this research-based virtual learning ecosystem.
